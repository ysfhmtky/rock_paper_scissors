# Rock-Paper-Scissors Simulation

A dynamic simulation game built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Watch as "rock," "paper," and "scissors" icons move randomly in a designated area, interact based on classic game rules, and compete until one type emerges victorious.

---

## Features

- **Random Movement**: Icons traverse the play area with unpredictable paths.
- **Collision Interaction**: When icons collide, game rules dictate the outcome:
  - Rock beats scissors (scissors turns into rock).
  - Scissors beats paper (paper turns into scissors).
  - Paper beats rock (rock turns into paper).
- **Winner Announcement**: The simulation ends with a single type of icon remaining.
- **Responsive Design**: Fully functional across various devices and screen sizes.

---

## How It Works

1. Launch the game using a development server.
2. Start the simulation by clicking the "Start Simulation" button.
3. Observe as icons interact and transform according to the rules.
4. The winner is determined when only one type of icon remains.
