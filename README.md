# Rock-Paper-Scissors Simulation

This is a simple simulation game built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The game takes place in a square area where "rock," "paper," and "scissors" icons move randomly, interact with each other, and follow the rules of the classic rock-paper-scissors game. The goal is to determine the winning type after all interactions.

## Features
- **Random Movement**: Icons move randomly within the square area.
- **Collision Detection**: Icons interact when they collide.
- **Game Logic**: 
  - Rock beats scissors (scissors turns into rock).
  - Scissors beats paper (paper turns into scissors).
  - Paper beats rock (rock turns into paper).
- **Winner Announcement**: The simulation stops when only one type of icon remains, and the winner is displayed.
- **Responsive Design**: The simulation works on different screen sizes.

## How It Works
1. Open the game in your browser using a development server.
2. Click the "Start Simulation" button to begin.
3. Watch as the icons move and interact with each other.
4. The game ends when only one type of icon remains, and the winner is displayed.
